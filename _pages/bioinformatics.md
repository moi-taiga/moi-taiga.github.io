## 👨‍🔬 About Me
<hr>

I’m a bioinformatician with a focus on single-cell transcriptomics, machine learning, and computational tools for cellular biology. My research centres on building interpretable models to map and understand cellular states and functions, particularly using gene expression data. I enjoy collaborative science, reproducible workflows, and creative problem-solving at the interface of biology and computation.
